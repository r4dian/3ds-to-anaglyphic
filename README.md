3ds-to-anaglyphic
=================

Batch convert 3DS photos to red-cyan anaglyphic images with Python 3 &amp; ~~PIL~~ Pillow. 

Converts 3DS photos to anaglyphic images for viewing on devices without 3d screens using your (my) 2 coloured 80s nerd glasses.

Requirements: A version of Pillow from after 25 Jul 2014 which is when MPO format support was added.

Windows .exe file included for people who can't/won't install Python.

Currently only produces images for red (left-eye) / cyan (right eye) glasses.
